AI-Powered Medical Diagnosis System

1. Introduction

1.1 Problem Statement

The increasing prevalence of chronic diseases such as heart disease, lung cancer, Parkinson’s, and hypothyroidism poses a significant challenge to the healthcare industry. Early detection plays a crucial role in managing these conditions, but limited accessibility to healthcare professionals and diagnostic tools often leads to delayed treatment. This project aims to bridge this gap using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) for automated medical diagnosis.

1.2 Motivation

The project was inspired by the growing need for fast, accurate, and accessible disease diagnosis. Many rural areas lack adequate medical facilities, and AI-based systems can aid in early detection, reducing the dependency on specialized healthcare professionals.

1.3 Objectives

Develop AI models for diagnosing multiple diseases.

Implement machine learning and deep learning techniques for accurate predictions.

Build an interactive web-based system for ease of access.

Enhance healthcare efficiency through automation.

1.4 Scope of the Project

Supports multiple disease detection using structured and unstructured medical data.

Utilizes deep learning models (CNNs) for medical images and ML algorithms (Decision Trees, SVMs) for structured data.

Designed for scalability and real-time medical diagnosis.
