# AI-Powered Medical Diagnosis System  

## 🔍 Overview  
This project leverages **AI and Machine Learning** to diagnose diseases such as **heart disease, lung cancer, Parkinson’s, and hypothyroidism** using medical datasets. The model is deployed using **Streamlit** for an interactive UI.  

## 🚀 Features  
- Predicts multiple diseases using trained AI models.  
- Uses CNNs, Decision Trees, and SVMs for accurate classification.  
- Deployed as a **user-friendly web application** with Streamlit.
